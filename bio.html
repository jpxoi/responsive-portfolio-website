                            Hi, my name is Jean Paul Fernandez, and I'm a 17-year-old Peruvian content creator and student. I hold advanced knowledge of video editing, music production, and the basics of software development.<br><br>

                            Since I was a child, I was passionate about technology. However, I also developed an interest in music, video production, and space exploration. I learned how to play the guitar and started to take an interest in EDM and Pop music. In 2015, inspired by big names in the industry like David Guetta, Martin Garrix, and Tiesto, I started my music project called JPXOi. In the beginning, I mainly focused on DJing and started to develop my skills through tutorials on YouTube and practicing a lot. Months later, I decided I wanted to learn how to make my own music. I was able to access free resources on Internet, and I studied the basics of music theory. I released my own album and some singles through my own record label called BassFab Records. The JPXOi project was abandoned from 2019 to 2021, mainly because I focused on other projects. Sadly, I decided to stop being a music artist and closed the JPXOi music project in May 2021. BassFab Records is still helping growing artists to achieve their goals, and I'm producing music for others. I decided to create Essential Music Group since I was releasing music in the name of other existing labels. In this way, those indie labels are now part of one record label.<br><br>

                            Music was not the only hobby I had. I was interested in video editing since I was 7. When I discovered Movie Maker, I started to make my own videos without help. I learned how to use it by myself, trying to understand how it worked. Years later, I decided to try Camtasia Studio, but soon I realized it was not for me. By 2014, I knew the basics of video editing on Sony Vegas Pro, which was my video editing software for a long time. For the next four years, I continued to develop my skills until I discovered Adobe Premiere Pro. This powerful NLE took my editing to the next level. Soon I started to learn more from other Adobe Creative Cloud software such as Adobe Audition, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe After Effects. I was able to integrate all these apps and make them useful for my video production. In 2019, I started my own video production company called Essential Creative Studios. My first production under the name of the company was a Year In Review video of my 2018. Also, this company allowed me to grow my skills in VFX and color grading. Currently, Essential Creative Studios offers video editing for personal and commercial use.<br><br>

                            What about space exploration? Since I was a child, I always enjoyed watching the stars with my telescope. By 2011, I decided I wanted to know more about it, and I started to investigate. I discovered many resources which helped me have a better understanding of the cosmos at a young age. Also, I learned about the past events in space explorations that allowed us as humankind to develop better technologies. By 2014, I started to hear the name of a space company called SpaceX. I knew their idea was good, and I've been following them since then. Also, it was a fundamental part of my major decision. That's why I'd like to study Aerospace Engineering after finishing my first major.<br><br>

                            When I got my first computer, I discovered the Internet. By that time, I thought it was magic, but soon I realized how things worked. Technology was an essential part of my childhood, and my willingness to make a better world by applying it is why I decided to study Computer Science in the first place. I learned how to use Word, PowerPoint, and Excel when I was 7. When I turned 10, I started to make my first databases and accounting systems in Excel. I learned a lot of those things on YouTube. And having good English at such a young age helped me to reach high-quality content. Also, I inscribed myself in programming courses when I was young. I learned how to build basic but functional apps for Android by using scratch-based programming languages.<br><br>

                            When the pandemic arrived, I was in my senior year at high school. I decided to learn the basics of marketing and SEO. I also took some courses on finances and got my first debit card. Additionally, I improved my design skills and used this knowledge to build my personal brand. I learned how eCommerce works and how to integrate payment APIs. Plus, I read more about cryptocurrency and investments. I started courses about productivity and how technology could help us save a lot of time if used correctly. Then, I began to learn how to code using Python. I can say 2020 was a year full of learning and experience.<br><br>

                            Currently, I'm developing my programming skills, specifically JavaScript and Python. I aspire to be a senior software developer and build my own company. I was always interested in Artificial Intelligence and machine learning because I knew these powerful tools would take humankind to the next level. I'm currently managing a blog focused on students and how tech can make their life easier. Also, I have plans on starting a podcast related to technology. Finally, my YouTube channel is not active yet, but I hope to start making tech-related videos by 2022.
